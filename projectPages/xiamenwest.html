    <h1>XIAMEN WEST SEAPORT</h1>
      <p>PROJECT TYPE: URBAN PLANNING | LOCATION: XIAMEN, CHINA | SIZE: 15,000,000 SF| STATUS: PROPOSAL</p>
      <p>The West Seaport Development, located at the western waterfront of Xiamen, was conceived through various site conditions that contextualize its site planning. It is divided into three distinct zones. The promenade alludes to the ebb and flow of the waves and creates a dynamic pedestrian zone along the waterfront. Walkways interweaves local eateries and boutiques with landscaped niches of green spaces and water features. These paths lead the foot of Xiamen Bridge, where a marina offers rentable docks, restaurants, boat maintenance and a variety of recreational activities such as skiing, sailing, canoeing, and yachting. The residential towers are broken down into 3 undulating masses that maximize ocean views while avoid to be perceived as dauntingly massive. Sky bridges between each form maintain physical connectivity and provide cross-circulation for residents.</p>
      <p>The promenade, inspired by the ebb and flow of the waves, establishes a dynamic pedestrian zone along the waterfront. Winding walkways intricately interlace local eateries and boutiques with landscaped niches of green spaces and water features, creating an inviting atmosphere for strolling and relaxation. These pathways seamlessly guide visitors to the foot of Xiamen Bridge, where a marina awaits, offering rentable docks, restaurants, boat maintenance, and an array of recreational activities such as skiing, sailing, canoeing, and yachting.</p>
      <p>The residential towers, designed with a keen awareness of their surroundings, are artfully broken down into three undulating masses. This deliberate approach not only maximizes mesmerizing ocean views but also ensures that the structures avoid appearing overwhelmingly massive. The inclusion of sky bridges between each form not only maintains physical connectivity but also provides essential cross-circulation for residents, fostering a sense of community and accessibility.</p>
      <p>In essence, the West Seaport Development is a testament to the thoughtful integration of architectural and natural elements, creating a vibrant and harmonious waterfront community in Xiamen that embraces both residents and visitors alike.</p>
