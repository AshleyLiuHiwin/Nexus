    <h1>XIAMEN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT</h1>
      <p>PROJECT TYPE: COMMERCIAL | LOCATION: XIAMEN, CHINA | SIZE: 600,000 SF| STATUS: PROPOSAL</p>
      <p>The vision for the Xiamen International Airport proposal is to seamlessly integrate efficient passenger flow and local connectivity while instilling a profound sense of belonging for travelers arriving and departing from the city. Situated in the northwest region of Xiamen Island, the current Terminal 1 building is slated for demolition and reconstruction, heralding a new era of airport design.</p>
      <p>A defining feature of the proposal is the parabolic cross-section roof line that gracefully sweeps across the entire complex in a singular gesture. Diamond-pleated skylights serve both functional and aesthetic purposes, maximizing the infusion of natural light while subtly delineating transitions from public to private spaces by regulating skylight sizes. The landside departure area boasts higher clearance, facilitating deep sunlight penetration through the perimeter glazing.</p>
      <p>The stacked multi-function belt ingeniously accommodates utilities, airport operations, passenger services, and retail spaces. Elevated hold rooms offer panoramic views of the entire airport field, creating a captivating and spacious environment for travelers. The pleated glass facade not only establishes a sense of scale in the urban context but also contributes to an architecturally striking visual identity.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, an elevated bridge ensures physical continuity with the existing Terminal 3, creating a seamless connection between past and future phases of the airport. This design proposal goes beyond functionality to redefine the airport experience, offering a blend of efficiency, aesthetics, and a welcoming atmosphere that reflects the spirit of the city.</p>
