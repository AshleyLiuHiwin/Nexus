    <h1>FUJISUNWAH TECH CAMPUS</h1>
      <p>PROJECT TYPE: URBAN PLANNING | LOCATION: XIAMEN, CHINA | SIZE: 15,000,000 SF| STATUS: PROPOSAL</p>
      <p>The Fujisunwah Campus occupies an expansive 500-hectare industrial site situated in the Inner Mongolia province, near the city of Ordos. The campus is thoughtfully designed with a focus on functionality and aesthetics.</p>
      <p>A dynamic public plaza serves as the gateway, inviting visitors to explore a gallery exhibition center and a dedicated research and development building. The headquarters operation center, elevated above, commands a central position in the architectural ensemble. Independent research and development facilities are strategically arranged along lanes that branch out from the main roads, fostering a sense of organization and accessibility. Adjacent to these, the manufacturing facilities stand as a formidable backdrop, forming the core of the operational body.</p>
      <p>This deliberate arrangement not only optimizes the utilization of the vast industrial land but also ensures a harmonious blend of functional zones within the Fujisunwah Campus, reflecting a commitment to both innovation and operational efficiency.</p>
