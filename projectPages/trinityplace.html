    <h1>TRINITY PLACE TOWER</h1>
      <p>PROJECT TYPE: MIXED USE | LOCATION: NEW YORK, NY | SIZE: 500,000 SF</p>
      <p> Situated in a vibrant mixed-use neighborhood, an existing single-story warehouse is poised to undergo a transformative vertical expansion, paving the way for office and community facility utilization. This initiative aims to bring greater diversity to the existing community. By strategically incorporating community facilities within the structure and leveraging bonus Floor Area Ratio (F.A.R.), we have successfully augmented the floor area by nearly 200%, breathing new life into the original single-story establishment.</p>
      <p>In strict adherence to local zoning requirements, the three-story extension graciously steps back 30 feet from both street fronts, minimizing direct impact on the existing street front and seamlessly integrating into the surrounding street wall context. The thoughtfully considered position of the new massing in relation to the lot and existing neighborhood context lays the groundwork for a design solution that is modern and contemporary yet unobtrusive. To enhance its aesthetic appeal and foster a connection with the outdoors, the new massing is elegantly enveloped in a full-height glass curtain wall.</p>
      <p>This harmonious blend of innovative design and conscientious urban planning reflects a commitment to modernity while respecting the existing neighborhood fabric. The result is a thoughtful and forward-looking architectural solution that both enhances the built environment and preserves the unique character of the community.</p>
