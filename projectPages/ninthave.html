    <h1>9TH AVENUE</h1>
    <p>PROJECT TYPE: MIXED USE | LOCATION: 154-17 9TH AVENUE QUEENS, NY | SIZE: 4,000 SF| STATUS: PROPOSAL</p>
    <p>Nestled within a residential enclave between the Whitestone Bridge and the Throgs Neck Bridge in Queens, NY, this single-family home exemplifies the courtyard house typology, a distinctive architectural venture within the urban fabric of New York City. At the owner's request, the design revolves around an open courtyard, seamlessly integrating light penetration and erasing the boundaries between the interior and exterior spaces, creating a unique living experience.</p>
    <p>Strategically maximizing the allowable floor area, the design caters to the needs of the client's growing family. Upon entry, visitors are welcomed by a parlor that opens up to the captivating courtyard. A hallway guides towards the more private dining room and kitchen, fostering a seamless flow between public and private spaces. The staircase ascends to the second floor, where two bedrooms, each with access to a roof terrace and complete with a full bathroom, provide a private retreat. The master bedroom, situated atop the house on the third floor, features an open bedroom layout, walk-in closets, and a luxurious master bathroom.</p>
    <p>An open-air garden blurs the lines between interior and exterior, contributing to a harmonious living environment. The central courtyard not only floods the cellar with natural light, creating an inviting living room space but also serves as a unique design element. A remarkable feature is the phantom car-lift in the ground floor garage, which lowers cars into the sub-cellarâ€”a dedicated space where the client showcases and stores their luxury car collection. This residence stands as a testament to innovative design, seamlessly blending functionality with aesthetic appeal in the heart of a vibrant Queens neighborhood.</p>
