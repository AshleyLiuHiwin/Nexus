      <h1>3512 UNION STREET</h1>
      <p>PROJECT TYPE: RESIDENTIAL | LOCATION: QUEENS, NY | SIZE: 31,000 SF| STATUS: PROPOSAL</p>
      <p>The envisioned structure is situated in the heart of Flushing, New York, within a mid-density residential district. The current streetscape boasts a harmonious blend of mixed-use establishments, characterized by commercial programs at ground level and residential units above. The proposed design seamlessly integrates with this urban fabric by extending the commercial streetscape at its base and introducing a residential tower above.</p>
      <p>In a thoughtful urban planning approach, the residential tower occupies a modest 60% of the available lot, allowing for increased elevation of the residential units. This deliberate choice not only enhances the living experience for residents but also contributes to a dynamic and visually engaging skyline. The remaining 40% of open space is transformed into a communal roof terrace, fostering a sense of community and providing a shared outdoor haven for the residents to enjoy.</p>
      <p>The orientation of living spaces is meticulously considered, with a south-facing arrangement to maximize solar gain and natural light. Solid vertical cores and mechanical supports strategically occupy the northern aspect, serving as a shield against winter wind invasion and optimizing the building's energy efficiency.</p>
      <p>This design not only respects the existing urban context but also introduces innovative solutions to enhance the quality of residential living. The integration of communal spaces, sustainable considerations, and a harmonious blend of commercial and residential elements positions the proposed building as a valuable addition to the evolving landscape of Flushing, embodying a balance between urban vibrancy and thoughtful residential living.</p>
